Hi there,

I would really love to use github.com/interstellar for an open source project I'm working on. I have interstellar.com and, as you know, github is the place for all things open source.

Is there anything I could trade you for this? I'd be happy to compensate you. My email is devongundry (at) gmail.com.

Thanks so much for considering it!
